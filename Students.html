<h1>Maryland Shaping Energy and Minds (M-SEM) </h1>
<div id="subtitle"><br />
Students work with me for their own growth. In the early years, I provide well-defined projects to help them build technical skills, habits, and a professional mindset—in other words, to do smart things smartly. Later, the goal is for them to catch a 'Tuna&rsquo;—tackling big, ambitious challenges—after learning how to catch sea bass and Branzino in a systematic and sustainable way.

<p>Temi joined the group in Fall 2024 as a first-year PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Maryland, College Park. He received his B.S. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineerings from the University of Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria. Prior to beginning his PhD at the University of Maryland, he worked briefly as an embedded systems engineer, developing remote monitoring and control systems for residential solar power systems. Currently, his research focuses on high-frequency power converters that can work over a wide-range of load impedances and power levels.</p>

<h3>Virtual Interactive STEM Teaching Aids</h3>
<p>The VISTA Team is composed of seven undergraduate students from diverse academic backgrounds, working under the guidance of Prof. Zan for three years until graduation. Our project focuses on developing remote access to physical labs, promoting inclusion, equity, and diversity in STEM education. 
The team members, listed from left to right in the accompanying photo, are: Nickey Zhang (Letters and Sciences), Harshil Agarwal (Computer Science), Daniel Kim (Computer Science), Alexander Campbell (Computer Science), Benjamin Nathan (Computer Engineering), Ayolani Akinwale (Computer Science), and Markell Morris (Mechanical Engineering). Together, we bring a multi-disciplinary approach to advancing remote learning in STEM fields.</p>
