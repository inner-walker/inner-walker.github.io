== Scalable Architectures for 100 MHz Wireless Power Transfer
=== Linearly scale up and down power level and transfer distance while maintaining efficiency
- Synchronized and identical modular converters drive the segmented coils actively and simultaneously  
- Partition the power conversion and transmission among modular converters and segmented coils instead of single higher-power ones
